APP NAME: Feeding Nigeria

Before  proceed, I know its meant for Teams but nobody was willing to Team up with me so I had to work solo

Overview: 
* This is an app whose aim is to put an end to food-wastage in Nigeria and Reduce Hunger 
* In Nigeria alone, 38 million tonne of Foods gets wasted every Year; All around the world, an average person consumes just 1 ton of food for a Year
* Over 100 million Nigerians are suffering from Hunger
* If the 38 million tonne of foods that gets wasted can be diverted towards the People plagued with Hunger, Hunger and Food-waste would be reduced drastically

Future Expectations:
* Fully building out a great Backend for app
* Working with API's to add in new features to app
* Helping out over 10 million Nigerian Families out of Hunger and Poverty.
* Equipping NIgerians with Life-coping skills

Finally, Thank you very much for giving me the privilege to be part of this Hackathon, I really do appreciate it
